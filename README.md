# Simple-LLM-model-with-Langchain

#### This project implements Langchain to develop a fundamental LLM model and includes the necessary code for accessing OpenAI's code.
#### Furthermore, it integrates the Langchain package for building chain models of LLM.
#### The entire end-to-end application is constructed using Streamlit.
#### Funny part,  the above description lines are created from this project's output itself. :)

## Happy Learning !!!
